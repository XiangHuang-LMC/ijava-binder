## course schedule

The rough schedule is this

- For the first half of the semester, we discuss mostly the procedure programming ideas. Although surely we need to use Java's class and occasionally create objects of some classes, we do not talk about the OOP idea a lot. Topics we will cover

  * Transfer from Python to Java


  * Java basic: simple classes and object notion
  * Java syntax: variables declaration, functions, selections, loops. 
  * Java functions 
  * Java arrays, 2D-arrays, and Strings 
  * Recursive functions

- For the second half, we will cover:

  * More on classes and objects (Ch 9). 
  * Object-Oriented thinking (Ch 10) 
  * Inheritance and Polymorphism (Ch 11)
  * Exception Handling and Text I/O (Ch 12)
  * Abstract Classes and Interfaces (Ch 13)
  * JavaFX Basics and Plus (Ch14 and more)
