    "# Feb 4: More on Selections and Boolean Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "In todays lab, we are going to try to use selection statement to decide whether a year is a leap year. \n",

    "## Task One: do it in main() function\n",
    "\n",
    "  You should write a program to:\n",
    "  0. Create a class with the name *LeapYear* that contains a main() function.  \n",
    "  1. Ask the user to input an integer representing a year, e.g., 2020. Store the data to a *int* type variable *year*.\n",
    "  2. You should use a variable *isLeapYear* of boolean type, initialize it as *false*.\n",
    "  3. If you find that the year number in 1. is a leap year, change *isLeapYear* variable to \n",
    "  *true*.\n",
    "  4. Output the result by printing out a message tell the user whether the year is a leap year. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Leap year logic\n",
    "To help you recall what is a leap year, here is the definition. \n",
    "> A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more structural language (sometimes we call it pseudo code; it looks like Java language but not really, to just express some ideas):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    isLeapYear = false\n",
    "    if (year is divisible by 100){ //century year\n",
    "        if year is divisible by 400{\n",
    "            then year is a leap year\n",
    "            and set isLeapYear accordingly\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        else{ //not divisible by 400\n",
    "            then year is not a leap year\n",
    "            and set isLeapYear accordingly\n",
    "        }\n",
    "                                  \n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else{\n",
    "        check if the year is divisible by 4 and set isLeapYear accordingly\n",
