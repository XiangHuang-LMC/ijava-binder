--Looks more like a reference book.

Java 7 for Absolute Beginners by Jay Bryant
--Covered classes/objects too late.

Java All-in-One for Dummies, 4th Edition by Doug Lowe
--Covered classes/objects too late.

Java for Dummies, 6th Edition by Barry Burd
--Covered classes/objects too late.

Java Illuminated: An Active Learning Approach, 4th Edition by Julie Anderson and Hervé Franceschi
--Covered classes/objects too late.

Simply Java: An Introduction to Java Programming by James Levenick
